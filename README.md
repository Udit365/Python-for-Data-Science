----

Although there are many libraries present to perform various operations related to data science in Python but, some of the most popular libraries that a data science enthusiast must know are as follows -:

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn

Similarly, for running machine learning algorithms, we have two famous libraries -:

1. Sckit Learn
2. Tensorflow

In this repository, I will provide the study material on all of the above topics.
